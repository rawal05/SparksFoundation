                    We do this by playing a bridge role between people who are interested in making a difference and organizations
                    working
                    on the ground to effect it.Our transparent and secure online donation medium help donors support causes that matter,
                    and assist them in making strategic, and effective grants. We partner with some of the most trusted charity
                    organizations in India and ensure that they have the necessary funds, training and support needed to enhance their
                    outreach and impact.
                
                    We follow the principles of transparency and accountability in all our work. We are accountable to our donors and
                    beneficiaries on how the funds are utilized. Our non- profit partners across geographical and thematic areas follow
                    norms of good governance and go through a thoughtfully designed due diligence process which is focussed on finding
                    and
                    strengthening groups that can make the most difference in their communities. Donate to NGOs in India, and make a
                    difference now.
